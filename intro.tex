\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

We pull together information from Jira and refer to other documents as needed to describe DP2 in more detail.

DP2 should be released to the community in 2026.
This document discusses the contents and timing of DP2.


\subsection{DP2 Scope} \label{sec:scope}
The goal of DP2, like DP1,  is to give well processed commisioning data to the science community - not any new features in RSP etc.
\subsubsection{Data}
DP2 comprises data from LSSTCam on sky and
\citeds{RTN-011} gives an outline of DP2.

DP2 will contain data with ireasonable PSF and from a footprint where we have a resdonable number of visits with LSSTCam.


\subsubsection{Science Platform}

Science Platform functionality for DP2 is still focusing on good user experience and system scalability rather than full feature capability.

Similar  capabilities that were not offered in DP1 will be offered in DP1.
These are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Temporary table upload for Qserv
    \item User query history
    \item User query management (requires the new Qserv front end)
    \item RA/DEC cutouts across patch/tract boundaries
    \item HIPS for full focal plane images
    \item Additional data-link annotations
    \item Butler Client-server
    \item Visit table in Qserv
    \item Portal-accessible user WebDAV service
    \item User quotas
\end{itemize}
