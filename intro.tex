\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Between April and September 2025, LSSTCam acquired a sequence of science-grade commissioning images, including small-field observations and the Science Validation surveys.
Data Preview~2 (DP2) will consist of a processed set of these observations and will
provide early access to science-grade LSSTCam data products to support preparation for LSST science in advance of Data Release~1.
This document describes the scope of DP2 and the plan for producing and serving its data products.
The intended audience is Rubin staff to use as reference on the DP2 dataset and delivery plan.

DP2 will include images and catalogs from LSSTCam data only (i.e. no AuxTel or LSSTComCam data will be included).
Prompt data product releases, alerts, and related services expected in 2026 are out of scope for this document and will be described elsewhere.

Expected release of DP2 to the data rights holders is mid-2026.
