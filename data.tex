\section{Dataset Definition}
\label{sec:dataset}

Data Preview~2 (DP2) will include LSSTCam observations acquired between 20 April 2025 and 21 September 2025.
It will also include any observations taken between 20 October 2025 and 1 January 2026 that overlap the Science Validation regions.
Within this temporal range, all visits labeled as science observations will be included.
Engineering data, out-of-focus sequences acquired for active optics commissioning, and stray-light scans will not be included.
Figure~\ref{fig:dp2-footprint} shows the resulting sky footprint.

The data products produced for DP2 will follow the categories defined in Table~6 of RTN-011.
These include calibrated and coadded image products, associated catalogs, and the corresponding calibration products.
A complete enumeration of DP2 data products will be provided later in this document.

No quality criteria will be applied to determine whether a visit is included in DP2.
However, quality criteria will instead determine whether a visit contributes to the coadds.
Visits will be included in the coadds only if the visit-level median PSF FWHM  is better than 1.7 arcseconds,  if each detector has a FWHM better than 1.8 arcseconds and a transparency of at least 0.75.
Out-of-focus data will naturally be excluded from the coadds because the pipelines fail to model the PSFs of donut images.

\subsection{Visit-level and Detector-level exclusions}
The eight heavily vignetted corner detectors  (0, 20, 27, 65, 123, 161, 168, 188) will be excluded.
Detectors 172, 24,  120, 121 will be excluded for data taken before 3 July 2025 because the data to calibrate them does not exist.

Table~\ref{tab:dp2-exclusions} summarizes the visit-level exclusions:

\subsection{Data taken after Oct 2025}
Data taken after Oct 2025 may be included pending the generation of suitable calibration frames for that epoch before processing starts.
If suitable calibration frames are made before processing, intent is to include data that covers the region in Figure~\ref{fig:dp2-footprint} in DP2.
Inclusion of single-frame data products (Visit Images and Sources) for all other ``science'' visits (BLOCK-407, BLOCK-408, BLOCK-416)  which are unsuitable for coadds may also be considered.
